## Overview

The **Pediatric Care Stability & Transparency Act (PCSTA)** is a process-first legislative proposal to ensure sustainable, abuse-proof funding for pediatric hospital care in the United States. PCSTA creates transparent allocation mechanisms, public dashboards, and robust audit trails to ensure equity, stability, and trust in children’s health services.

## What Does PCSTA Do?

- **Establishes Transparent Funding Mechanisms:**  
  All pediatric hospital funding flows are tracked, with public reporting and audit logs.

- **Protects Against Abuse & Gaming:**  
  Objective, open criteria for allocation prevent manipulation or favoritism.

- **Equity & Stability:**  
  Ensures no abrupt funding “cliffs,” and provides special lanes for safety-net and rural hospitals.

- **Open Data & Accountability:**  
  Real-time dashboards, public performance metrics, and built-in GAO spot-audits.

- **Family & Advocate Participation:**  
  Public input windows for proposed funding formula changes.
